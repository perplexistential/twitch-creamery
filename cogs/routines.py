# This is intended as an example of how one could implement routines in a Cog.
# Let it serve as a repository of shared routines, important dates too.

# I do not recommend adding this cog directly, but making a copy and modifying
# it, or borrowing from it whatever routines you want.

    # https://twitchio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exts/routines.html
    # This routine will run at the same time everyday. If a naive datetime is
    # provided, your system local time is used.

    # The below example shows a routine which will first be ran on the 1st,
    # June 2021 at 9:30am system local time. It will then be ran every 24 hours
    # after the initial date, until stopped.

    # If the date has already passed, the routine will run at the next
    # specified time. For example: If today was the 2nd, June 2021 8:30am and
    # your datetime was scheduled to run on the 1st, June 2021 at 9:30am, you
    # routine will first run on 2nd, June 2021 at 9:30am.

    # In simpler terms, datetimes in the past only care about the time, not the
    # date. This can be useful when scheduling routines that donâ€™t need to be
    # started on a specific date.
